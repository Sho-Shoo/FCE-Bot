# FCE-Bot 

Wechat chatbot service to query Carnegie Mellon University Faculty Course Evaluation (FCE) info. Backend service is 
deployed on AWS EC2 with Docker. Any WeChat user can access this service by searching for "CMU Bot" account. We strive 
to become the one stop shop for CMU community information so the following feature is also scheduled for development: 

- Canvas assignment deadline reminder service 
- CMU dining location operation hour lookup 
- Library reservable public space lookup 

**Any open-source contribution will be highly appreciated!**
